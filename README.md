<h1>Predict Housing Prices on Qualitative Data Using a Decision Tree</h2>
<p>This is a machine learning model that uses decision trees to predict housing prices. We use a decision tree because our data set consists of qualitative data about houses. Our data doesn't include features common to other housing datasets like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.</p>

<p>We tested three models SVM Regression, Random Forest Regression and Decision Tree Regression. DTR resulted in superior performance on the data set.</p>

<p>Overall, we achieve a low RMSE comparable to academic studies of housing data. It was superior to other tutorial methodologies found on websites like Towardsdatascience. Given its simplicity, we find this model useful.</p>
