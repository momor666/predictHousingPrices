# predictHousingPrices
This is a machine learning model that uses decision trees to predict housing prices. We use a decision tree because our data set consists of qualitative data about houses. Our data doesn't include features common to other housing datasets like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

We tested three models SVM Regression, Random Forest Regression and Decision Tree Regression. DTR resulted in superior performance on the data set.

Overall, we achieve a low RMSE comparable to academic studies of housing data. It was superior to other tutorial methodologies found on websites like Towardsdatascience. Given its simplicity, we find this model useful.
